# stocks-v1
## What is it?
A simple stock market web app that I worked on while teaching myself React & Redux, learning the ways of ES6, and easing my configuration pains with webpack.  It is very much a work-in-progress and incomplete (feature-wise).

*This is the first React app that I've ever worked on, so please take that into consideration if reviewing the code :).*

## What does it do?
It's very simple, and can be broken down into three main features:
  1.  *Search* - find and view stock price information by stock symbol
    NOTE:  Search functionality is currently incomplete
  2.  *Watchlist* - quickly see your favorite stocks at a glance
  3.  *Headlines* - the most recent financial news headlines and stories
  
## Why?
Because I wanted to write an app using React.  

I have previously written or worked on apps using Angular and Meteor (w/ Blaze), and I wanted to see what all of the excitement about React is.  Having a real app to work on while learning the concepts helps reinforce them in my mind and do something beyond what a beginner tutorial can offer.

I may eventually port this to a native app using React Native.
